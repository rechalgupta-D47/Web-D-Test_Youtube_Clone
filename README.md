Capstone Project: Develop a YouTube Clone Using the MERN 
Stack (400 marks) 

Objective: Create a full-stack YouTube clone where users can view and interact with videos. 
This project will help you understand how to build a real-world application using MongoDB, 
Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). 

Requirements: 
Front-End (React) 

1. Home Page: 
○ Display a YouTube Header. 
○ Display a static sidebar which you can toggle from the top hamburger menu. 
○ Display filter buttons at the top. 
○ Display a grid of video thumbnails. 
○ Each video card should show: 
■ Title 
■ Thumbnail 
■ Channel Name 
■ Views 
Sample data for videos: 
Sample Data: 
[ { "videoId": "video01", "title": "Learn React in 30 Minutes", "thumbnail URL": 
"https://example.com/thumbnails/react30min.png", "description": "A quick tutorial to get started 
with React.", "channelId": "channel01", "uploader": "user01", "views": 15200, "likes": 1023, 
"dislikes": 45, "uploadDate": "2024-09-20", "comments": [ { "commentId": "comment01", "userId": 
"user02", "text": "Great video! Very helpful.", "timestamp": "2024-09-21T08:30:00Z" } ] }]

3. User Authentication: 
○ Allow users to register and log in with: 
■ Username

When the user clicks on sign in, then it should take to a new URL where a google form 
to login and register should be present. 
User should sign in and after signing in, his/her name should be present at the top and 
the home page will be displayed.

{ userId: "user01", username: "JohnDoe", email: "john@example.com", password: 
"hashedPassword123", avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/johndoe.png", channels:
